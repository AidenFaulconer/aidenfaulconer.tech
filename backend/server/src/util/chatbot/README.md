Create a new Rasa project using the command rasa init in the command line. Define the bot's domain by creating a domain.yml file in the domain directory. In this file, you can define the intents, entities, actions, and responses that the bot should recognize and use. Copy code intents:

- greet
- inquire_about_product
- inquire_about_return
- inquire_about_shipping
- inquire_about_store_location
- inquire_about_order

entities:

- product
- order_number

actions:

- action_greet
- action_answer_product_inquiry
- action_answer_return_inquiry
- action_answer_shipping_inquiry
- action_answer_store_location_inquiry
- action_answer_order_inquiry
- action_unable_to_help Create a data directory, where you can store training data for the bot in the form of stories and nlu data. The stories are a series of dialogue flow that the bot should follow and nlu data is used to train the natural language understanding component of the bot. Copy code

  ## stories

- greet

  - action_greet

- inquire_about_product

  - inquire_about_product
  - action_answer_product_inquiry

- inquire_about_return

  - inquire_about_return
  - action_answer_return_inquiry

- inquire_about_shipping

  - inquire_about_shipping
  - action_answer_shipping_inquiry

- inquire_about_store_location

  - inquire_about_store_location
  - action_answer_store_location_inquiry

- inquire_about_order

  - inquire_about_order
  - action_answer_order_inquiry

- cannot_help

  - any_other_input
  - action_unable_to_help Create a config.yml file in the root directory of your project to configure the Rasa pipeline. Copy code language: en pipeline:

- name: "NLU" path: "models/nlu"

- name: "Core" path: "models/core" Train the bot using the command rasa train in the command line. Start the bot using the command rasa run in the command line. The bot should now be able to understand customer inquiries, use the pre-configured data to respond with appropriate answers, and report back if a customer cannot be satisfied through the bot.

Please note that this is just a simplified example and in real world scenario, you should plan your NLU, entities and intents, story's and action's based on the queries and requirements of the domain you want to build the chatbot for.

To set up the rest of the project on your server, you will need to:

Copy the project files to your server. You can use a tool like scp to copy the files over to the chatbot folder on your server. Install the necessary dependencies for Rasa on your server by running pip install rasa or pip3 install rasa depending on your python version. Train the bot on your server by running the command rasa train in the project directory Start the bot by running rasa run --enable-api this will start the server on your localhost and you can use the API to interact with it. You can use a tool such as ngrok to expose the API to the internet, so that it can be accessed by your customers. It is also worth noting that, in order for the bot to work, you will need to configure it with proper credentials such as access tokens, API keys and so on, according to the platform the chatbot is supposed to interact with.

As you may be aware, setting up a chatbot and making it run can be a complex task and is beyond the basic code snippets that I provided. If you have any further questions or are facing any specific issues, feel free to ask.
