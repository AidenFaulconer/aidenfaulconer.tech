metaDescription: Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a project for
  Recovery VR, where I created a dashboard in Vue for practitioners to deliver
  tasks to clients in VR. The clients were undergoing physical rehabilitation,

  library of games to give to their clients.

Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a project for Recovery VR, where I created a dashboard in Vue for practitioners to deliver tasks to clients in VR. The clients were undergoing physical rehabilitation, and the dashboard provided a way for practitioners to select from a large library of games to give to their clients.

One of the key features of the dashboard was the game selection process. With such a large library of games to choose from, it was important to have a way for practitioners to easily find the right game for their clients. To accomplish this, we implemented a categorization system that allowed practitioners to filter games by type, difficulty, and other factors. This made it easy for practitioners to quickly find the right game for their clients.

Another important aspect of the dashboard was the measurement system. We used Unity to create a dummy bone setup that reported data back to Firebase via a GraphQL wrapper. This allowed practitioners to track their clients' progress and see how they were doing over time.

One of the benefits of using GraphQL in this project was that it simplified querying to Firebase. Instead of having to write complex queries, practitioners were able to use simple, intuitive GraphQL queries to retrieve the data they needed. This made it easy for them to quickly access the information they needed to track their clients' progress.

In addition to the measurement system, we also worked on allowing practitioners to view what the clients were seeing in their VR headsets. This provided practitioners with valuable insight into what their clients were experiencing, and allowed them to make more informed decisions about how to help their clients progress in their rehabilitation.

Overall, I'm very proud of the work we did on this project. The dashboard we created was an effective tool for practitioners to deliver tasks to their clients in VR, and the measurement and game selection features were particularly useful in helping practitioners track their clients' progress and select the right games for their needs. I'm glad that we were able to contribute to the important work being done by Recovery VR, and I hope that our dashboard will help many people on their path to recovery.
