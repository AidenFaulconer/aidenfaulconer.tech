Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a project for Signs of Green, a small business that specializes in creating custom signs and graphics. In this project, I was responsible for helping the company with its logo and branding, as well as designing and developing their website.

One of the first things we tackled was the company's logo and branding. The existing logo was outdated and didn't accurately reflect the company's services or aesthetic. We worked with the owner to come up with a new, modern logo that better represented the company. We also developed a color palette and font choices that would be used consistently across all of the company's marketing materials.

Once the logo and branding were finalized, we moved on to designing and developing the website. The existing website was outdated and didn't provide much information about the company's services or pricing. We worked with the owner to create a new website that was professional and visually appealing, while also being easy to navigate. We included information about the company's services, pricing, and portfolio, as well as a contact form to make it easy for potential customers to get in touch.

After the website was launched, we saw a rapid growth in the company's online presence. The new website helped to attract new customers, and the updated branding helped to establish the company as a professional and trustworthy business. The owner was very happy with the results, and has seen a significant increase in business since gaining an online presence.

Overall, I'm very proud of the work we did on this project. The new logo and branding for Signs of Green helped to modernize the company and establish it as a professional business, and the new website provided a valuable online presence. I'm glad that we were able to help the company grow and succeed, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for Signs of Green.
