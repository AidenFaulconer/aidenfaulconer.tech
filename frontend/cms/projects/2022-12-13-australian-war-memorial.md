we had the opportunity to collaborate with the Australian War Memorial on a virtual reality (VR) experience called "On Closer Inspection". The goal of this project was to give users the ability to explore the museum's assets in a new and immersive way.

Our team, led by Aiden Faulconer, began by creating a Unity app that allowed users to view and interact with 3D Lidar scanned museum assets. This included high-resolution images of objects on display at the museum, as well as detailed scans of the museum's architecture. The app also included a variety of interactive features, such as the ability to zoom in and out, rotate objects, and view them from different angles.

Once the app was complete, we worked closely with the museum to create the VR experience. Using VR headsets, users were able to fully immerse themselves in the app and explore the museum's assets in a way that would not be possible in real life. The VR experience was a huge success, with many users praising its ability to bring the museum's collections to life in a new and exciting way.

Overall, we are incredibly proud of the work that Aiden Faulconer and our team at the software development agency were able to accomplish on this project. The "On Closer Inspection" VR experience is a testament to the power of technology to enhance and enrich the museum experience, and we are grateful to have been able to play a role in bringing it to life.

In order to create the "On Closer Inspection" VR experience, our team at the software development agency utilized a range of cutting-edge technologies. The most important of these was Lidar scanning, which allowed us to capture highly detailed 3D models of the museum's assets. This technology uses lasers to measure the distance to objects and create a precise 3D map of their surfaces.

Using Lidar scanning, we were able to capture the museum's collections with a level of detail and accuracy that would not have been possible using traditional photography or 3D modeling techniques. This allowed us to create a highly realistic and immersive VR experience that accurately reflects the museum's collections.

In addition to Lidar scanning, we also utilized the Unity game engine to create the VR app. This allowed us to quickly and efficiently build a user-friendly interface that would allow users to explore the museum's assets in a natural and intuitive way. We also incorporated a variety of interactive features, such as the ability to zoom in and out, rotate objects, and view them from different angles.

One of the key challenges we faced during the development of the VR app was ensuring that it would be accessible to a wide range of users. To this end, we made sure to incorporate a variety of settings and controls that would allow users to adjust the app to their individual needs and preferences. For example, users were able to adjust the app's field of view, depth of field, and other settings to suit their personal preferences.

Overall, we are extremely proud of the work we were able to accomplish on the "On Closer Inspection" VR experience. The combination of Lidar scanning, Unity, and other technologies allowed us to create a truly immersive and engaging VR experience that brings the museum's collections to life in a new and exciting way. We are grateful to have been able to work with the Australian War Memorial on this project, and we look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with VR technology.
