title: Managing projects in Azure Dev Ops
metaDescription: Using source control, branches, and Azure DevOps is a powerful
  way to manage and collaborate on code projects. Source control is a system
  that tracks changes to files, allowing multiple people to work on the same
  codebase at the same time. Branches are used to create separate versions of
  the codebase, allowing different features or bug fixes to be developed
  independently and then merged together. Azure DevOps is a cloud-based platform
  that provides tools for source control, branching, and collaboration, as well
  as many other features for managing the development process.

Using source control, branches, and Azure DevOps is a powerful way to manage and collaborate on code projects. Source control is a system that tracks changes to files, allowing multiple people to work on the same codebase at the same time. Branches are used to create separate versions of the codebase, allowing different features or bug fixes to be developed independently and then merged together. Azure DevOps is a cloud-based platform that provides tools for source control, branching, and collaboration, as well as many other features for managing the development process.

One of the key benefits of using source control, branches, and Azure DevOps is that it allows developers to work on different aspects of a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. For example, if one developer is working on fixing a bug in the code, they can create a branch to isolate their changes from the main codebase. This allows other developers to continue working on new features without being impacted by the bug fix. When the bug fix is ready, it can be merged into the main codebase, and everyone's changes can be incorporated together.

Another benefit of using Azure DevOps is that it provides a central location for managing tasks and tracking progress. Developers can create tasks and assign them to themselves or others, and then update the status of the tasks as they are completed. This allows the development team to see what work is being done and by whom, and helps to keep the project on track.

To get started with source control, branches, and Azure DevOps, you will need to create an Azure DevOps account and set up a project. Once you have done this, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a local Git repository on your computer by running the **`git init`** command.
2. Connect your local repository to Azure DevOps by running the **`git remote add`** command and specifying the URL of your Azure DevOps project.
3. Create a new branch for your work by running the **`git branch`** command and specifying a name for the branch.
4. Switch to the new branch by running the **`git checkout`** command and specifying the name of the branch.
5. Make your changes to the code on the branch.
6. Commit your changes to the branch by running the **`git commit`** command and adding a commit message.
7. Push your changes to Azure DevOps by running the **`git push`** command.

Here is an example of these steps in action:

```
# Create a local Git repository
$ git init

# Connect to Azure DevOps
$ git remote add origin https://dev.azure.com/my-project

# Create a new branch
$ git branch feature-xyz

# Switch to the new branch
$ git checkout feature-xyz

# Make some changes to the code
$ vim main.py

# Commit the changes to the branch
$ git commit -m "Added new feature XYZ"

# Push the changes to Azure DevOps
$ git push


```

Once you have pushed your changes to Azure DevOps, you can create a pull request to merge the branch into the main codebase. A pull request is a request for the changes on your branch to be reviewed and incorporated into the main codebase.

To create a pull request, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Azure DevOps project and navigate to the "Code" section.
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab and then click on the "New pull request" button.
3. Select the branch that you want to merge and the target branch (usually the main branch) and click on
4. Review the changes that will be included in the pull request, add a title and a description, and then click on the "Create pull request" button.

Once the pull request is created, other members of the development team can review the changes and provide feedback. When the changes are ready to be merged, a team member with the appropriate permissions can approve the pull request and merge the branch into the main codebase.

Using source control, branches, and Azure DevOps can help to improve the collaboration and organization of your code projects. By keeping track of changes, isolating work on different branches, and providing a central location for managing tasks and progress, you can ensure that your development process is efficient and effective.

Azure DevOps is a cloud-based platform that provides tools and services for managing the development process, including source control, branching, and collaboration. It is part of the Azure cloud computing platform and is designed to help development teams work together more efficiently and effectively.

One of the key features of Azure DevOps is the ability to create and manage work items, such as tasks, bugs, and features. Work items are used to track the progress of development and can be assigned to individual team members. They can also be linked to other work items and to source code changes, providing a complete picture of the development process.

In addition to work items, Azure DevOps provides many other features for managing the development process, including:

* Source control: Azure DevOps includes built-in support for Git, the popular distributed version control system. It provides tools for managing code repositories, tracking changes, and collaborating with other team members.
* Build and release pipelines: Azure DevOps allows you to create build and release pipelines to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your code. You can define the steps in the pipeline and specify the triggers that will start the pipeline, such as pushing a change to the code repository.
* Testing: Azure DevOps provides tools for managing and running tests, including unit tests, functional tests, and performance tests. It can automatically run tests as part of the build and release process, and provides reports and insights into the results.
* Collaboration: Azure DevOps includes features for collaborating with other team members, such as discussions, feedback, and alerts. It also integrates with other tools, such as Slack and Microsoft Teams, for seamless communication and collaboration.
* Monitoring and diagnostics: Azure DevOps provides tools for monitoring and diagnosing issues with your applications, including logs, metrics, and alerts. This can help you to identify and resolve problems quickly and keep your applications running smoothly.

Overall, Azure DevOps is a comprehensive platform for managing the development process and collaborating with other team members. By using its features and tools, you can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your development team and deliver high-quality software faster.
