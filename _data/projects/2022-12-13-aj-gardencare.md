Recently, I had the opportunity to work on a project for AJ Garden Care (now Boon Gardenscapes), a gardening and landscaping company. In this project, I was responsible for creating a booking and quoting form for the company's website, as well as designing and deploying the website.

One of the key features of the website was the booking and quoting form. This form allowed potential customers to easily book a service or request a quote from the company. The form was designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear fields and instructions to guide users through the process. We also added validation to ensure that all the necessary information was provided, which helped to streamline the booking and quoting process.

In addition to the booking and quoting form, we also worked on the design of the website. We wanted to create a website that was professional and visually appealing, while also being easy to navigate. To accomplish this, we worked with a team of designers to create a clean, modern look that matched the company's brand. We also carefully organized the content on the website to make it easy for users to find the information they were looking for.

Once the website was designed and built, we then moved on to deploying and hosting it. We chose a reputable hosting provider and carefully tested the website to ensure that it was ready for public use. Once we were satisfied that everything was working properly, we launched the website and made it available to the public.

The launch of the website was a huge success. The booking and quoting form quickly became a valuable tool for the company, and the design of the website was well-received by users. The website also helped to increase the company's online presence and attract new customers.

Overall, I'm very proud of the work we did on this project. The website we created for AJ Garden Care (now Boon Gardenscapes) was a valuable tool for the company, and the design and functionality of the site were well-received by users. I'm glad that we were able to contribute to the success of the company, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for Boon Gardenscapes.
